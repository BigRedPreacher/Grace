'Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures.' Ephesians 2:8-9 further clarifies that salvation is 'not of works, lest any man should boast.' Trusting in anything other than Christâ€™s finished work, such as works, sacraments, or repentance of sins, is a false gospel (Galatians 1:8-9).",
    "how does a person get saved": "To be saved, a person must trust in the shed blood of Jesus Christ, believing in His death for their sins, His burial, and His resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Salvation is by grace through faith, not by works, baptism, or following the law (Ephesians 2:8-9).",
    "repentance": "'Repentance' in the Bible means a change of mind about unbelief, not turning from sin as a condition for salvation. Acts 20:21 teaches repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ."
